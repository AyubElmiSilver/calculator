# calculator
In this project, I will be creating a calculator using html, css and javascript. The project will be broken down in several components listed below.

The first part will be creating functions for all basic math operations add, subtract, multiply and divide. I will create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above operation functions on the numbers. This will be tested via the browser console.
